            <h2>Assembly</h2>
                <h3>STEP 1</h3>
                    <p>Slide the Allen wrench into the Allen wrench holder.</p>
                    <p>
                    Next, locate the top, bottom, left, and right boards. Notice that the left and right boards have corners with two holes, while the top and bottom boards have one hole in each corner. The top board will be smooth on the side with four holes, while the bottom board will be smooth on the side with ten holes. The left and right boards are indistinguishable until assembled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Now locate two long Allen screws. Connect the top board and right board by screwing the long Allen screws into the smooth side of the top board and the small skinny side of the right board using the Allen wrench, making sure that the smooth side of both boards is facing away from the middle.
                    </p>         
                <h3>STEP 2</h3>
                    <p>Find three column boards and six dowels. Hammer two dowels into the top side of each of the three column boards.</p>
                    <p>Push the column boards into the middle part of the top board using the dowels on the top of the column boards.</p>
                    <p>Next, locate the three row boards and twelve dowels. Hammer two dowels into each of the two small skinny sides of each of the three row boards.</p>   
                <h3>STEP 3</h3>
                    <p>
                    Push a row board into the right board so that it touches the column boards, using the dowels on the row board. Make sure the smooth side of the row board is facing up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Locate six dowels and hammer them into the bottom of the row board. Then, locate three column boards and push them into the bottom of the last row board.
                    </p>
                    <p>Repeat Step 3 until you are out of column boards.</p>
                <h3>STEP 4</h3>
                    <p>
                    Locate the left board and push it onto the dowels sticking out of the row boards, making sure the two holes in each corner of the left board align with those in the right board.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Locate two long Allen screws and, using the Allen wrench, screw them into the top and left boards.
                    </p>
                <h3>STEP 5</h3>
                    <p>
                    Locate six dowels and hammer two into the bottom of each of the three bottom column boards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Next, locate the bottom board. Push the bottom board onto the column boards with the exposed dowels, making sure the smooth side of the bottom board is facing up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Now locate four long Allen screws. Using the Allen wrench, screw the four long Allen screws into the four corners of the bottom board.
                    </p>
                <h3>STEP 6</h3>
                    <p>
                    Locate ten floor pads. For each floor pad, peel off the film and place the pad in an uncovered position on the bottom of the bottom board.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Make sure each pad lines up with a hole that is on the top of the bottom board.
                    </p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <details>
                <summary><b>What tools do I need to assemble the KALLAX shelving unit?</b></summary>
                <div>
                    The assembly of your KALLAX shelving typically requires: a Phillips screwdriver, a rubber or wooden
                    mallet, and the hex key (Allen wrench) provided by IKEA for tightening bolts.
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><b>Approximately how long does it take to assemble a KALLAX unit?</b></summary>
                <div>
                    Assembly typically takes about 30–60 minutes for one person and about 20–40 minutes with two people.
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><b>Can the KALLAX shelving unit be securely mounted to the wall?</b></summary>
                <div>
                    Yes. IKEA provides wall-mounting hardware with each unit. Securing your shelving is strongly
                    recommended for taller units.
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><b>How much weight can each shelf on the KALLAX unit hold?</b></summary>
                <div>
                    Each shelf supports up to 29 lbs (13 kg) evenly distributed. Avoid exceeding this to prevent damage.
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><b>Can I position my KALLAX unit either horizontally or vertically</b></summary>
                <div>
                    Yes, KALLAX shelves can be positioned horizontally or vertically. Vertical positioning requires wall
                    anchoring for safety.
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><b>What is the best method to clean and maintain my KALLAX shelving?</b></summary>
                <div>
                    Use a soft, lint-free cloth dampened lightly with warm water and mild detergent. Avoid abrasive
                    cleaners
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><b>Can I customize my KALLAX shelving with additional inserts, drawers, or doors?</b></summary>
                <div>
                    Yes, IKEA offers various accessories including inserts, drawers, doors, and baskets specifically
                    designed for KALLAX.
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><b>Is it safe to disassemble and reassemble my KALLAX shelving multiple times</b></summary>
                <div>
                    Frequent disassembly can weaken the shelving. Limit repeated assembly to maintain structural
                    integrity.
                </div>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary><b>What is the safest way to move my KALLAX unit after it has been assembled?</b></summary>
                <div>
                    Always lift the unit from the bottom with another person's help. Avoid dragging or lifting by
                    shelves.
                </div>
            </details>
